# AI Governance Policy

> **Aligned with**: ISO/IEC 42001:2023 — Artificial Intelligence Management System (AIMS)
>
> This document provides a governance template for organizations using DevTrail. It maps ISO 42001 clauses to DevTrail document types, enabling teams to build compliance-ready documentation as part of their development workflow.
>
> **This is a template** — adapt each section to your organization's context.
